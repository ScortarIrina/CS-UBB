Create a database to manage train schedules. The database will store data about the routes of all the trains. 
The entities of interest to the problem domain are: Trains, Train Types, Stations, and Routes. Each train has a name and belongs to a type. 
A train type has a name and a description. Each station has a name. Station names are unique. Each route has a name, an associated train, 
and a list of stations with arrival and departure times in each station. Route names are unique. The arrival and departure times are 
represented as hour:minute pairs, e.g., train arrives at 5 pm and leaves at 5:10 pm.


Requirements:

   1. Write an SQL script that creates the corresponding relational data model.

   2. Implement a stored procedure that receives a route, a station, arrival and departure times, and adds the station to the route. 
      If the station is already on the route, the departure and arrival times are updated.
   
   3. Create a view that shows the names of the routes that pass through all the stations.

   4. Implement a function that lists the names of the stations with more than R routes, where R is a function parameter.
