                Although I like coding, I absolutely love sports. A sport that helps me truly
                relax (but only mentally) is hiking. <br> Althoungh every hike feels endless when ascending, when I get
                to the top of the mountain, I feel the happiness (as you can see on my face) and gratitude that I got to
                experience such a feeling. Mot of my hikes were in the Apuseni Mountains.

            <h3>Hiking during spring</h3>
            <p>
                You get to see the beautiful wildflowers first make their appearances.
                It's exciting to hike once or twice a week during the spring monthsA,
                because each time you go out, different flowers will have popped up.

            <h3>Hiking during summer</h3>
            <p>
                You will find the lush forest alive and vibrant. Some bushes will have
                lost their flowers and turned to seed. Blueberries start to appear as
                well as black berries and raspberries; you and all the other animals will
                want to have a taste. Rain will be refreshing on hot days and trees will
                have full canopies, offering their shade to tired hikers.

            <h3>Hiking during autumn</h3>
            <p>
                Hiking in Fall, you will be impressed by nature's artistic display.
                Maples will turn bright shades of orange, red and yellow.
                Sourwood will also be responsible for some bright reds in the landscape.
                Animals will be scurrying around preparing for winter. The days will get cooler,
                and the soft crunch of leaves beneath your feet will remind you that winter is approaching.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h3>Hiking during winter</h3>
            <p>You will marvel at how far you can see through the bare branches of trees and shrubs.
                Only evergreens will be able to block your views. Rhododendrons will curl their leaves
                and waterfalls could be frozen in a permanent ice sculpture. You may find yourself alone,
                and the mountains will feel naked, peaceful and quiet.</p>
