In this lab you will have to develop a server-side web application in PHP.
The web application has to manipulate a Mysql database with 1 to 3 tables and
should implement the following base operations on these tables:
select, insert, delete, update.

Also the web application must use AJAX for getting data asynchronously from
the web server and the web application should contain at least 5 web pages
(client-side html or server-side php).

For the database, you can use the mysql database on www.scs.ubbcluj.ro.
On this myql server you have an account, a password and a database,
all identical to your username and password on the SCS network.

Please make sure that you avoid sql-injection attacks when working with the database.

Have in mind the user experience when you implement the problem:
    - add different validation logic for input fields
    - do not force the user to input an ID for an item if he wants to delete/edit/insert it;
      this should happen automatically (e.g. the user clicks an item from a list, and a page/modal
      pre-populated with the data for that particular item is opened, where the user can edit it)
    - add confirmation when the user deletes/cancels an item
    - do a bare minimum CSS that at least aligns the various input fields

Write a web application for managing users in an enterprise system.
The application should maintain various information about users in the database
(i.e. name, username, password, age, role, profile, email, webpage etc.).
The application should implement: user browsing (use AJAX for retrieving users from a specific role),
user lookup based on his name, adding, removing and updating a user.
Also, on the browsing page, the filter used for the previous browsing action (i.e. role),
should be displayed (do this in javascript).
